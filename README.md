# AWS Systems Manager ASP.NET Core Data Protection Provider
[![nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Amazon.AspNetCore.DataProtection.SSM.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.AspNetCore.DataProtection.SSM/)

[Amazon.AspNetCore.DataProtection.SSM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.AspNetCore.DataProtection.SSM/) allows you to use [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)'s [Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html) to store keys generated by ASP.NET's Data Protection API.
This enables you to scale by allowing multiple web servers to share the keys.

The library introduces the following dependencies:

* [AWSSDK.SimpleSystemsManagement](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.SimpleSystemsManagement/)
* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Extensions/)

# Getting Started

Follow the examples below to see how the library can be integrated into your application.

## ASP.NET Core Example
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDataProtection()
        .PersistKeysToAWSSystemsManager("/MyApplication/DataProtection");

    services.AddMvc()
        .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_1);
}
```
